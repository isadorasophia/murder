# Hi there! If you want to load .ttf fonts use the following format: 
# <index> <path-to-font>: <font-size> [<offsetX> <offsetY>] [charsDefineFile.txt]
# For example: 
#   100 FontName.ttf: 16
#
# You can access your font in Murder according to the index you chose. Remember that some indices (100+) are reserved 
# for the built-in engine fonts!
#
# - Empty lines, or starting with '#' are ignored.
#
# The fonts here are by Chevy Ray, used with permission. You can buy the whole pack (40+ fonts!) here: http://pixel-fonts.com/
